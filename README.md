# FileUpload-RunPythonFile-FileDownload
This project allows to upload a file (csv or any file) then run python file and allows download the file (maybe output from python file).
Sometime for running some ML project we may need to take an input file from the user and then run our python script generate output file and allow them to dopwnload that file. Here in this repo I will ask user for some csv file (not necessarily csv) and then run a python file and generate an output csv file and allow download the output file to user.
